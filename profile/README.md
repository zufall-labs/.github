## Why We Started
In the current landscape, entropy solutions are often reserved for large enterprises, leaving small teams and individuals without access to these powerful tools. Zufall Labs was founded to democratize access to entropy, providing innovative solutions that are affordable and easy to use for everyone.

## What We Are Working On
We are developing a SaaS platform that brings the power of entropy to your fingertips. Our goal is to create a service that is both affordable and easy to integrate, enabling anyone to leverage advanced entropy solutions in their projects.

## About Us
We are a group of everyday people with a passion for technology and community. At Zufall Labs, we believe in creating tools that empower individuals and small teams to achieve their goals. Our mission is to make advanced technology accessible to all, fostering innovation and collaboration.
